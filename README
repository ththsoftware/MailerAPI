MailerAPI is a Python API for integration with the validation.js with the bootstrap template utilized on ththsoftware.com

Here I will add the credits for this bootstrap template and the validation.js
 For the whole template:
  <!-- =======================================================
  * Template Name: iPortfolio - v1.4.0
  * Template URL: https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/
  * Author: BootstrapMade.com
  * License: https://bootstrapmade.com/license/
  ======================================================== -->
  For validation.js
  /**
  * PHP Email Form Validation - v2.1
  * URL: https://bootstrapmade.com/php-email-form/
  * Author: BootstrapMade.com
  */

I am not utilizing the php backend that they have prebuilt. However the validation.js file has been included in the free version of this template.

In keeping with the user agreement I am not using the contact.php file with the php library.

I have built this API to operate independantly from the website so changes to validation.js or the creation of a new AJAX sender for greater flexibility.

Flask and smtplib are the packages that need to be installed to utilize these python files.

This is a portfolio item, not a product.
